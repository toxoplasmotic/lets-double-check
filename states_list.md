The [United States of America]() is a [federal republic]()[\[1\]]() consisting of 50 [states](), a [federal district]() ([Washington, D.C.](), the [capital city]() of the United States), five major [territories](), and [minor islands]().[\[2\]]()[\[3\]]() Both the states and the United States as a whole are each sovereign jurisdictions.[\[4\]]() The [Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]() allows states to exercise all powers of government not delegated to the federal government. Each state has its own [constitution]() and government. All states and their residents are represented in the federal [Congress](), a [bicameral]() legislature consisting of the [Senate]() and the [House of Representatives](). Each state elects two senators, while representatives are [distributed]() among the states in [proportion]() to the most recent [constitutionally]() mandated decennial [census]().[\[5\]]()

Each state is entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the [Electoral College](), the body that elects the [president of the United States](), equal to the total of representatives and senators in Congress from that state.[\[6\]]() The federal district does not have representatives in the Senate, but has a non-voting [delegate]() in the House, and it is entitled to electors in the Electoral College. Congress can [admit]() more states, but it cannot create a new state from territory of an existing state or merge two or more states into one without the consent of all states involved. Each new state is admitted on an [equal footing]() with the existing states.[\[7\]]()

The United States possesses fourteen territories. Five of them ([American Samoa](), [Guam](), the [Northern Mariana Islands](), [Puerto Rico](), and the [United States Virgin Islands]()) have a permanent, non-military population, while nine of them (the United States Minor Outlying Islands) do not. With the exception of [Navassa Island](), Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which are located in the [Caribbean](), all territories are located in the [Pacific Ocean](). One territory, [Palmyra Atoll](), is considered to be [incorporated](), meaning the full body of the Constitution has been applied to it. The other territories are [unincorporated](), meaning the Constitution does not fully apply to them. Ten territories (the Minor Outlying Islands and American Samoa) are considered to be [unorganized](), meaning they have not had an [organic act]() enacted by Congress. The four other territories are [organized](), meaning an organic act has been enacted by Congress. The five inhabited territories each have limited autonomy and territorial legislatures and governors. Residents cannot vote in federal elections, although all are represented by non-voting delegates in the House.

The largest state by population is [California](), with a population of 39,538,223 people. The smallest is [Wyoming](), with a population of 576,851 people. The federal district has a larger population (689,545) than both Wyoming and [Vermont](). The largest state by area is [Alaska](), encompassing 665,384 square miles (1,723,340 km2). The smallest is [Rhode Island](), encompassing 1,545 square miles (4,000 km2). The most recent states to be admitted, Alaska and [Hawaii](), were admitted in 1959. The largest territory by population is Puerto Rico, with a population of 3,285,874 people, larger than 21 states. The smallest is the Northern Mariana Islands, with a population of 47,329 people. Puerto Rico is the largest territory by area, encompassing 5,325 square miles (13,790 km2). The smallest territory, [Kingman Reef](), encompasses 0.005 square miles (0.013 km2), or a little larger than 3 acres.
